# Data Visualisation: US-Demography and Italy's 2022 Heatwave
Working as a team of three data scientists, we delivered a two‑part analytics project that takes raw public data all the way to interactive insights:

1️⃣ U.S. County Demography Explorer
Data : NHGIS population series (2000 & 2010) for 3,100 counties.

What we built : automated R pipeline (tidyverse + sf) that cleans, joins shapefiles, and feeds a Shiny + Leaflet dashboard. Users click any county to see real‑time race break‑downs—and instantly verify census numbers such as Los Angeles County’s 9.8 M residents.

2️⃣ Climate‑Health Impact for Italy, Summer 2022
Data : ERA5 land temperatures (2015‑2023) + World Mortality Dataset.

Method : Python pipeline (pandas, xarray, statsmodels) to model expected deaths with week fixed effects, then quantify excess mortality.

Insight : ≈ 26,800 excess deaths linked to the 2022 heatwave; bin‑scatter visuals highlight a sharp mortality jump beyond the 95th‑percentile temperature.


🔧 Tech & Skills
R (tidyverse, Shiny, Leaflet) • Python (pandas, xarray, statsmodels, cartopy) • CDS & NHGIS APIs.
Spatial data wrangling │ time‑series modelling │ interactive dashboards │ agile teamwork.

Result : a compact showcase of how we transform gigabytes of climate and demographic data into actionable, recruiter‑ready insights. Let’s talk if you’re looking for data talent that bridges engineering, analytics and compelling storytelling. 📩
